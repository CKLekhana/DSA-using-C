# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms written in C. The goal of this project is to build a strong understanding of core concepts through low-level implementation.

## 📌 Features

- Custom implementations of common data structures  
- Modular design using header files  
- Separate compilation and linking  
- Practice-oriented algorithm implementations  

## 🧱 Implemented Data Structures

- Arrays  
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks  
- Queues  
- Vectors (dynamic arrays)

## ⚙️ How to Compile

Example:

```bash
gcc -c header/vector.c -o vector.o
gcc -c test/vectorTest.c -o vectorTest.o
gcc vectorTest.o vector.o -o program

```

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is part of my practice to:

- Strengthen understanding of pointers and memory management
- Improve modular programming in C
- Prepare for system-level programming and technical interviews
